Was fairly easy to create the organization


Roles didn’t quite match up with what was requested. We were able to add a maintainer but not able to set a contributor.


We thought it was interesting that you can close issues in a pull request by saying “closes #i” where i is the number of the issue


We see how in a real life scenario the maintainer may not accept the PR and we may have to make changes.


We had a merge conflict when working in parallel but it was fairly easy to fix
